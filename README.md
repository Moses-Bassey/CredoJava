# CredoJava

A Java API wrapper for the facilitation of quick and easy development and integration of Java based applications with the the Credo API.

CredoJava removes the grunt involved in consuming the Credo API and implements a diverse array of helper methods to enable rapid prototyping and testing. 

## Links
- Project: https://github.com/Moses-Bassey/CredoJava


## Getting started
### Dependencies:
- Unirest (Installation procedures here: https://github.com/Mashape/unirest-java#installing)

### CredoJava installation:
- Download CredoJava
- Add jar file as a Module to your Java project:
- On Intellij IDEA: File -> Project Structure -> Modules -> Dependencies Tab -> Add -> JARs or Directories -> Attach jar
- On Netbeans: Project properties -> Libraries -> Compile -> ADD JAR/folder -> Add Jar


## Examples

To create a new Credo payments:
```java
Payments payments = new Customers();
customers.pay("[transRef]", "[amount]", "[customerEmail]","[customerName]", "[paymentOptions]", "[customerPhoneNo]", "[currency]","[redirectUrl]", "[reason]")
```

**Remember to always shut down the API connection once you are done making requests**
#### CredoJava utilizes a background event loop and your Java application won't be able to exit until you manually shutdown all the threads by invoking:
```java
ApiConnection.shutDown();
```

## NOTE
### CredoJava utilizes a Keys.json file for the management of api key resources. This file must be placed in your root project directory and has the following structure:
```json
{
  "API_KEYS":{
    "KEY_IN_USE": "sk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "TEST_SECRET_KEY": "sk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "TEST_PUBLIC_KEY": "pk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "LIVE_SECRET_KEY": "sk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "LIVE_PUBLIC_KEY": "pk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  }
}
```
### The value attached to KEY_IN_USE is the value used for Authorization by CredoJava
